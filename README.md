# Online-Voting
An online voting system with email verification is designed to ensure the integrity and security of the voting process by confirming the authenticity of voters through their email addresses. The system begins with user registration, where individuals provide their email addresses and other necessary details. Upon registration, an email containing a verification link or code is sent to the user. Clicking the link or entering the code verifies the email address and activates the user's account, ensuring that only legitimate and verified individuals can vote. Once verified, users can log in and cast their votes on the designated election or poll. The system records each vote securely, maintaining privacy and preventing unauthorized access. After the voting period concludes, the system counts the votes and generates results, which are then presented in a secure and transparent manner. This approach not only enhances the credibility of the voting process but also helps in preventing fraudulent activities and ensuring that only eligible participants have a say in the election outcomes.
